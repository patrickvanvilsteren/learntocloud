### Learning goals

My role is going to focus more on Cloud, Systems and Data. That's why I follow this course, to get more foundational knowledge about Cloud systems like Github and Terraform.
Als I like to focus on Azure first because I got my AZ-104 in the past. But at my work we also use AWS and I would like to do the course with that as well.
I also would like to be able to create my own projects and be confident to use Github as a Portfolio for my experience.
